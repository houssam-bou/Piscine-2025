#  1337 Piscine 2025

This repository contains my solutions to the **1337 (42 Network) Piscine 2025** exercises.  
The Piscine is an intensive month-long C programming bootcamp designed to test problem-solving, logic, and persistence.  
Each directory corresponds to a set of projects focused on specific C language concepts.
